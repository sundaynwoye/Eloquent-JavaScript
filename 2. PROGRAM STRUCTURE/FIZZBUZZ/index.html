        <h1>EXERCISE</h1>
        <h1>FIZZBUZZ</h1>
        <p>Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100,
            with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the
            number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.
            When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz" for
            numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz"
            for numbers divisible by only one of those).
            (This is actually an interview question that has been claimed to weed out
            a significant percentage of programmer candidates. So if you solved it, your
            labor market value just went up.)

                    console.log("FIZZBUZZ")
                } else if (num % 3 === 0) {
                    console.log("FIZZ")
