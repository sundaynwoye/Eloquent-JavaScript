        <h2>CHESSBOARD</h2>
        <p>Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid, using newline
            characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space
            or a "#" character. The characters should form a chessboard.
            Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:</p>
        <p>When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding size
            = 8 and change the program so that it works for any size, outputting a grid
            of the given width and height.
            </p>

        <script>
            let str = "";
            let size = 8;
            for (let i = 1; i <= size; i++) {
                for (let j = 1; j <= size; j++) {
                    let sum = i + j;
                    if (sum % 2 === 0) {
                        str += " ";
                    } else {
                        str += "#";
