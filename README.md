# Solutions for exercises in Eloquent JavaScript

This book contains roughly three parts. The first 12 chapters discuss the JavaScript language. The next seven chapters are about web browsers and the way JavaScript is used to program them. Finally, two chapters are devoted to Node.js, another environment to program JavaScript in. There are five project chapters in the book that describe larger example programs to give you a taste of actual programming.

The language part of the book starts with four chapters that introduce the basic structure of the JavaScript language. They discuss control structures (such as the while word you saw in this introduction), functions (writing your own building blocks), and data structures. After these, you will be able to write basic programs. Next, Chapters 5 and 6 introduce techniques to use functions and objects to write more abstract code and keep complexity under control.

After a first project chapter that builds a crude delivery robot, the language part of the book continues with chapters on error handling and bug fixing, regular expressions (an important tool for working with text), modularity (another defense against complexity), and asynchronous programming (dealing with events that take time). The second project chapter, where we implement a programming language, concludes the first part of the book.

The second part of the book, Chapters 13 to 19, describes the tools that browser JavaScript has access to. Youâ€™ll learn to display things on the screen (Chapters 14 and 17), respond to user input (Chapter 15), and communicate over the network (Chapter 18). There are again two project chapters in this part: building a platform game and a pixel paint program.

Chapter 20 describes Node.js, and Chapter 21 builds a small website using that tool.
