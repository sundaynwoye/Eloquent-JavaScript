        <h1>THE SECRET LIFE OF OBJECTS EXERCISE</h1>
        <h2>GROUPS</h2>
        <p>
            The standard JavaScript environment provides another data structure called 
            Set. Like an instance of Map, a set holds a collection of values. Unlike Map, it 
            does not associate other values with those—it just tracks which values are part 
            of the set. A value can be part of a set only once—adding it again doesn’t have any effect.
        </p>
        <p>
            Write a class called Group (since Set is already taken). Like Set, it has add, 
            delete, and has methods. Its constructor creates an empty group, add adds a 
            value to the group (but only if it isn’t already a member), delete removes its 
            argument from the group (if it was a member), and has returns a Boolean 
            value indicating whether its argument is a member of the group.
        </p>
        <p>
            Use the === operator, or something equivalent such as indexOf, to determine 
            whether two values are the same.
        </p>
        <p>
            Give the class a static from method that takes an iterable object as its 
            argument and creates a group that contains all the values produced by iterating 
            over it.
        </p>

                add(value) {
                    if (!this.has(value)) {
                        this.#members.push(value);
                    }
                }

                delete(value) {

                has(value) {
                    return this.#members.includes(value);

                        group.add(item);
